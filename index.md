title: Smart house - My journey in home automation
---
These pages will describe my journey in home automation. I started around 2021 playing with openhab to automate the chicken pen. Over the years i have gained some experience with my experimentation. Some things work, some don't.

I am planning to describe some specific projects; 
* The automation of the chicken pen
* The creation of a CO2 meter using ESPHome
* How OpenHAB, Home assistant and other components work together
